# Vehicle-Parking-System
I’m excited to share my latest academic project, Vehicle Parking System, developed using PHP and MySQL, designed to solve real-world parking management challenges.
Project Overview – Vehicle Parking System

The Vehicle Parking System is a web-based application developed using PHP and MySQL to efficiently manage vehicle parking operations in a digital manner. The system automates the process of vehicle entry, slot allocation, payment, and exit, reducing manual work and improving accuracy.

The application supports role-based access for Admin, Staff, and Users. Users can log in, view available parking slots in real time, select a preferred slot, enter vehicle details, make payment using QR scan, and exit the parking on the same day. The system automatically updates slot availability after vehicle exit.

Admins can manage users, staff, parking slots, and parking charges, while staff members assist in vehicle monitoring and record management. The system maintains a centralized database to track all parking activities, ensuring transparency, security, and easy retrieval of records.
